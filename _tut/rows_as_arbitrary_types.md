Other tutorials covered decoding rows as [collections](rows_as_collections.html), [tuples](rows_as_tuples.html)
and [case classes](rows_as_case_classes.html). While those are the most common scenarios, it is sometimes necessary
to decode rows into types that are none of these.

Let's take the same example we did before:

```scala
val rawData: java.net.URL = getClass.getResource("/wikipedia.csv")
```

This is what this data looks like:

```scala
scala> scala.io.Source.fromURL(rawData).mkString
res0: String =
Year,Make,Model,Description,Price
1997,Ford,E350,"ac, abs, moon",3000.00
1999,Chevy,"Venture ""Extended Edition""","",4900.00
1999,Chevy,"Venture ""Extended Edition, Very Large""",,5000.00
1996,Jeep,Grand Cherokee,"MUST SELL!
air, moon roof, loaded",4799.00
```

Now, let's imagine we have a class that is not a case class into which we'd like to decode each row:

```scala
class Car(val year: Int, val make: String, val model: String, val desc: Option[String], val price: Float) {
  override def toString = s"Car($year, $make, $model, $desc, $price)"
}
```

Providing decoding support for our `Car` class is as simple as implementing an instance of [`RowDecoder`] for it
and marking it as implicit.

There are various ways to implement an instance of [`RowDecoder`], but by far the most idiomatic is to use one of
the various helper methods defined in its [companion object]({{ site.baseurl }}/api/#kantan.csv.RowDecoder$). For our
current task, we need to decode a row into 5 values and stick them into `Car`'s constructor: we want [`decoder`].

```scala
import kantan.csv.ops._
import kantan.csv._

implicit val carDecoder = RowDecoder.decoder(0, 1, 2, 3, 4) { (y: Int, m: String, mo: String, d: Option[String], p: Float) â‡’
  new Car(y, m, mo, d, p)
}
```

And we can now decode our data as usual:

```scala
scala> rawData.asCsvReader[Car](',', true).foreach(println _)
Success(Car(1997, Ford, E350, Some(ac, abs, moon), 3000.0))
Success(Car(1999, Chevy, Venture "Extended Edition", None, 4900.0))
Success(Car(1999, Chevy, Venture "Extended Edition, Very Large", None, 5000.0))
Success(Car(1996, Jeep, Grand Cherokee, Some(MUST SELL!
air, moon roof, loaded), 4799.0))
```

The main reason this is the preferred solution is that it allows us never to have to think about individual cells in a
row and how to decode them - we just have to describe what type we're expecting and let kantan.csv deal with decoding
for us.

Note that [`decoder`] also takes a list of indexes as parameter - these map each parameter to a index in a CSV row.
If, as is our case here, there's an exact mapping between the parameters of our construction function and the cells
of each CSV row, the [`ordered`] method is slightly easier to call.
